title: Student Research
---

My research group is located at Swarthmore College and focused on the measurement and analysis of forensic-decision-making processes.

Opportunities for current Swarthmore students include:

-   Full-time summer research opportunities
-   Academic-year hourly work
-   Independent studies for academic credit

Interested students should contact me for further information. Desired prerequisites are Stat021 (Statistical Methods II) and Stat051 (Probability), but if you have some coding experience or are especially interested in statistical problems in forensics and the law, please be in touch! Students willing to work with the team for multiple semesters will be given priority.

If you are a researcher at Swarthmore College or another institution looking to collaborate, please contact me.

## Highlights

**Thomas Daillak '23** and **Sherry Huang '24** were co-authors on "A Comparison of IRT-based methods for Spatial Responses", which was accepted for publication in *Quantitative Psychology* after completing the peer-review process.

**Horace Shew '22** received an honorable mention in the [CMSAC Reproducible Research Competition](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/conference/2021/) (Methods-Student Track) for his paper ["**Applying Hierarchical Bayesian Models to ATP Data"**](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/conference/2021/assets/pdf/HoraceShew.pdf)**.**

**Riley Thompson '22** was a co-author on "Modeling Covarying Responses in Complex Tasks", which was accepted for publication in *Quantitative Psychology* after completing the peer-review process.
